      <p>
        Tiffany is awesome and super grateful to anyone who helped her, mostly
        Jennifer,and also Jerrica, Qusai, Rixio, Sage, Daisy, Chris, and
        probably others that she can't remember. You guys are all the best. My
        family is super cool too for putting up with me while I code. Also,
        thanks to Axel Fuhrmann who created the API and made it so simple and
        fun to use. Finally, thanks to Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for making
        such a show.
